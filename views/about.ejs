				CodeClub is devoted to helping anyone and everyone learn computer

				CodeClub will provide a structured format and a social-outlet for motivated
				students who have chosen to learn how to code on their own. All ages and
				skill levels are welcome.

				Hi, my name is Brian and I am not a professional programmer.
				Although, I have been learning to code on my own for quite some time.
				One day, it occurred to me that it would be a lot more fun if I could code
				with other people. Even if that meant teaching them what I know first.
				We could then all learn how to code together (really well) and maybe even
				build some cool stuff in the process.
				<br>
				If you already know how to code, don't worry, you will have fun too.
				The focus here isn't on skill level, but rather the social aspect of working
				together on something meaningful. I want to meet cool people who share a
				similar interest.
