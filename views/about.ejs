	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>CodeClub is devoted to helping anyone and everyone learn computer
		programming and/or become highly skilled coders. Focused on adult learners,
		CodeClub will provide a structured format and a social-outlet for motivated
		students who have chosen to learn how to code on their own. All ages and
		skill levels are welcome.</p>

<br>
	<p>Our friendly and supportive atmosphere is perfect for people who know:</p>

	<ol class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item">absolutely nothing about computer programming.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">a little, but could really use some help.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">a lot and would love to team up with others to build cool stuff.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">a little or a lot and love to teach others.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Background</h1>

	<p>Hi, my name is Brian and I am not a professional programmer.
		Although, I have been learning to code on my own for quite some time.
		One day, it occurred to me that it would be a lot more fun if I could code
		with other people. Even if that meant teaching them what I know first.
		We could then all learn how to code together (really well) and maybe even
		build some cool stuff in the process.</p>

	<p>If you already know how to code, don't worry, you will have fun too.
		The focus here isn't on skill level, but rather the social aspect of working
		together on something meaningful. I want to meet cool people who share a
		similar interest.</p>
