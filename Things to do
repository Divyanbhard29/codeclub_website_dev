1- The icon link should always take you to the landing page
2- Another index page doesn't really make sense
3- Landing page should only contain a brief info of what we are doing 
4- index page/ home page should have a little information or a dashboard of latest infos and then if anyone wanted to read more, there should be a join button like (Join our team).
5- the "Join the club" button on landing page should be removed. 
6- new and edit page forms are too low from the top, margin-top should be decreased.
7- the buttons are quite big and the capitalized text doesn't really look fancy.
